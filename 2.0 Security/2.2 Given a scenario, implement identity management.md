## 1) â€¢ Account creation and deletion

- useradd : user add
  ```
  $ useradd -h # SEE the HELP!! (-d,-G,-k,-m)
  $ useradd -r sysuser # TO create a system user(-r)
  $ sudo useradd -d /home/user -m -G {sudo,adm} username
  ```
  - useradd configuration file : /etc/default/useradd
  - **adduser** : Same as useradd but more verbose option.
  - `adduser` is a higher-level utility for adding users, often offering a more user-friendly and interactive experience, typically found in Debian-based systems. `useradd` is a lower-level, command-line tool for adding users, offering more granular control but requiring more detailed input, and is available across various Linux distributions.

- groupadd
  ```
  $ groupadd {name}
  ```
  - `groupadd` is a low-level command used for creating new groups in Unix-like operating systems, offering precise control but requiring more detailed input. `addgroup` is a higher-level utility, typically found in Debian-based systems, providing a more user-friendly and interactive interface for creating groups.
    
- userdel
  ```
  $ userdel -h # SEE the HELP!! (-f, -r)
  $ userdel -rf {user}
  ```
  - `userdel` is a low-level command used for deleting user accounts in Unix-like operating systems, requiring precise input and offering granular control. `deluser` is a higher-level utility found in Debian-based systems, providing a more user-friendly and interactive way to remove user accounts.

- usermod : modification the user
  ```
  $ usermod -h # SEE the HELP!! (-G,-a)
  # Note :- -G for group, -a to append (user -aG username)
  $ usermode -G {groupname} -a {user}
  
  ```
- groupmod
- id
  ```
  $ id {user}
  ```
- who : The `who` command in Unix-like operating systems displays a list of users currently logged into the system. It provides information such as the username, terminal name, date and time of login, and the remote host (if applicable).
- w : The `who` command in Unix-like operating systems displays a list of users currently logged into the system. It provides information such as the username, terminal name, date and time of login, and the remote host (if applicable).
- passwd : to set password for user (-l lock the password of the named account)
- Default shell : The default shell in Unix-like operating systems is typically `bash` (Bourne Again Shell). However, other common default shells can include `sh` (Bourne Shell), `zsh` (Z Shell), and `csh` (C Shell), depending on the system configuration and user preferences.

- Configuration files
- /etc/passwd :- user info file     # (" $ vipw ")
- /etc/shadow :- user info file     # (" $ vipw -s ")
- /etc/group  :- group file         # (" $ vigr ")
- /etc/gshadow:- group shaadow file # (" $ vigr -s ")
- /etc/skel : where contains basic structure of home directory
  ```
  $ cd /etc/skel/
  ```
- /etc/default/useradd : configuration file useradd command 
- /etc/profile
- .bash_profile
- .bashrc

## 2) Account management

- passwd : to change the password
  ```
  $ passwd {user}
  ```
- chage :- passwd agent
```
  $ chage -h
  $ chage -l {user}
```
- pam_tally2 
- faillock
- /etc/login.defs
