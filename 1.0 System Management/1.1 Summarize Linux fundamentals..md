### Linux + objective 1.1

# 1.1 Summarize Linux fundamentals.

# 1) Filesystem Hierarchy 
---
- /home <- user home directories
- /root <- root uer's home directory
---
- /boot <- boot loader, kernel files
- /etc <- text config files (etcetera? "etsy")
- /opt <- add-on software packages
- /media <- remobeable media mount location
- /mnt <- temp mounted filesystems (i use for more)
- /tmp <- temp files, usually deleted on reboot

### Virtual Filesystems:

- /dev <- hardware represented as files, hard drive, com port, etc
- /proc <- generated on the fly, proc & kernel info
- /sys <- info about devices, drivers, kernel
---
- /sbin <- essential system binaries
- /bin <- essential binaries 
- /lib <- libraries for /bin and /sbin

- var <- files that r/w a lot, logs, emails
- /var/tmp <- temp files Not deleted during reboot

# 2) Basic boot Process

- UEFI : -    Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
- BIOS : -    Basic Input output system (BIOS)

#### - Boot Sources

- Hardware :- PXE, IPXE, USB, Hard disk, CD/DVD
- GRUB2 :- ISO file, Memtest, other OS

- ``` bash
  # Boot file for the system
   /boot
   /boot/efi
   /boot/efi/
  ```
  - grub editable file are stored 
  ```
  # to do any changes to grub, edit 
  /etc/default/<grub>
  # after edith grub configuration
  $ update-grub
  ```
 - in Redhat or rockylinux (update-grub does't exist)
   
    ```
    # After updateing /etc/default/grub   
    $ grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    # -o is for output file
    ```
# 3) Device types in /dev

  - In linux devices are in /dev folder
    ```
    /dev/zero # it like a stream of null characters
    /dev/null # it like a black hole
    /dev/random # it provide 32bit random number every time
    /dev/urandom # produces randomness based on a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator and does not block.
    ```
    
#  4) Listing hardware information

    - lspic :- to lsit pci device (network card)
    - lsusb :- USb devices
    - dmidecode :- (dmidecode -t (bios,keybord,processor,memory)) to see the details of every thing 

#  5) Storage concepts

  - file : file, Directories, ex: ext4, btrfs, ntfs, etc
  - black : bing chunks data, file systems often built on top of block storage, ex: iscsi, SAN
  - Object : entire object has UUID, only accessed by API, Slower but cheap, ex: Amazon S3, blob, storage

###  Desks (RAID) levels
      - Raid 0 :- very fast, offers striping for improved performance but lacks redundancy
      - Raid 1 :- mirrors data for fault tolerance
      - Raid 5 :- combines striping and parity for both performance and fault tolerance

# 6) Basic package compilation from source

  - In Debian system you need to install build-essential
  - In Redhad system you need to install "Development Tools"
    ```
    sudo <dnf> grupinstall "Development Tools"

    sudo apt install build-essential
    ```

  - To buld from source, first you check ./config to it is compatibile
    ```
    $ ./configure # to configure 
    $ make       # make the configure 
    $ sudo make install # copy every like libers and man pages
    ```
