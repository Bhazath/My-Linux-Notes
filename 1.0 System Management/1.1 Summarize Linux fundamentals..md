Linux + objective 1.1
# 1) Filesystem Hierarchy 
---
- /home <- user home directories
- /root <- root uer's home directory
---
- /boot <- boot loader, kernel files
- /etc <- text config files (etcetera? "etsy")
- /opt <- add-on software packages
- /media <- remobeable media mount location
- /mnt <- temp mounted filesystems (i use for more)
- /tmp <- temp files, usually deleted on reboot

### Virtual Filesystems:

- /dev <- hardware represented as files, hard drive, com port, etc
- /proc <- generated on the fly, proc & kernel info
- /sys <- info about devices, drivers, kernel
---
- /sbin <- essential system binaries
- /bin <- essential binaries 
- /lib <- libraries for /bin and /sbin

- var <- files that r/w a lot, logs, emails
- /var/tmp <- temp files Not deleted during reboot

# 2) Basic boot Process

- UEFI : -    Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- BIOS : -    Basic Input output system

#### - Boot Sources

- Hardware :- PXE, IPXE, USB, Hard disk, CD/DVD
- GRUB2 :- ISO file, Memtest, other OS

- ``` bash
  # Boot file for the system
   /boot
   /boot/efi
   /boot/efi/
  ```
  - grub editable file are stored 
  ```
  # to do any changes to grub, edit 
  /etc/default/<grub>
  # after edith grub configuration
  $ update-grub
  ```
 - in Redhat or rockylinux (update-grub does't exist)
   
    ```
    # After updateing /etc/default/grub   
    $ grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
    # -o is for output file
    ```
# 3) Device types in /dev

  - In linux devices are in /dev folder
    ```
    /dev/zero # it like a stream of null characters
    /dev/null # it like a black hole
    /dev/random # it provide 32bit random number every time
    /dev/urandom # produces randomness based on a cryptographic pseudorandom number generator and does not block.
    ```
