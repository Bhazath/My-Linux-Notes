## 1. Disk partitioning

- Commands
- fdisk : The fdisk command in Linux is a disk partitioning utility used to create, delete, modify, and manage partitions on hard drives. 
```
sudo fdisk /dev/<sdb>
```
```

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.38.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

This disk is currently in use - repartitioning is probably a bad idea.
It's recommended to umount all file systems, and swapoff all swap
partitions on this disk.

The device contains 'LVM2_member' signature and it will be removed by a write command. See fdisk(8) man page and --wipe option for more details.

Device does not contain a recognized partition table.
Created a new DOS (MBR) disklabel with disk identifier 0xd598187a.

Command (m for help): m

Help:

  DOS (MBR)
   a   toggle a bootable flag
   b   edit nested BSD disklabel
   c   toggle the dos compatibility flag

```
  - n : add a new partition
    - p : primary partion select(default p)

    - default and enter enter
    - W : Wrtie table to disk and exit
    - q : quit without saving chnages 
- `Note` : The `dd` command in Linux is a versatile tool used for low-level copying and conversion of raw data. It is commonly used for tasks such as creating disk images, making bootable USB drives, and performing data backups or recovery by copying data from one device or file to another.
```
# to wipe the Hard disk
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb count=100
```
- parted :The `parted` command in Linux is a disk partitioning tool used to create, delete, resize, check, and copy partitions and the file systems on them. It supports both MBR and GPT partitioning schemes and can handle large disks, making it suitable for complex partition management tasks.

- partprobe : The `partprobe` command in Linux is used to inform the operating system kernel of partition table changes. This is particularly useful after modifying disk partitions with tools like `fdisk` or `parted`, ensuring that the kernel is aware of the new partition layout without needing a system reboot.

## 2. Mounting local and remote devices
- systemd.mount
- /etc/fstab
- mount
- Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS)
- External devices

## 3. Filesystem management
- XFS tools
- Ext4 tools
- Btrfs tools

## 4. Monitoring storage space and disk usage

- df : The `df` command in Linux displays disk space usage. Use `df -h` for human-readable format, showing sizes in GB/MB. The output includes filesystem name, size, used space, available space, and mount point.
- du : The `du` command in Linux estimates file and directory space usage. Use `du -h` for a human-readable format, showing sizes in GB/MB. It provides the disk space used by files and directories, recursively if needed.
```
du -h --summarize <folder>
```

## 5. Creating and modifying volumes using Logical Volume Manager (LVM)
- Commands
- pvs
- vgs
- lvs
- lvchange
- lvcreate
- vgcreate
- lvresize
- pvcreate
- vgextend

## 6. Inspecting RAID implementations
- mdadm
- /proc/mdstat

## 7. Storage area network (SAN)/network-attached storage (NAS)

- multipathd
- Network filesystems
  - Network File System (NFS)
  - Server Message Block
    (SMB)/Common Internet
    File System (CIFS)

## 8. Storage Hardware

- lsscsi  : The `lsscsi` command in Linux lists all SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) devices. It provides information about connected storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and CD-ROMs.
- lsblk  : The `lsblk` command in Linux lists information about all available or specified block devices. It displays details such as device name, type, size, and mount points in a tree-like format.
  ``` lsblk | grep -v {loop} <don't want thing >  ```
  
- blkid  : The `blkid` command in Linux is used to display or search for block device attributes, including UUIDs and file system types. It provides a quick way to identify information about all block devices on the system.
- fcstat  : The `fcstat` command is typically found in AIX (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) rather than Linux. It is used to display statistics for Fibre Channel devices and adapters, helping administrators monitor performance and diagnose issues related to Fibre Channel hardware.
  - this is only if you have fiber channel
  - flags
    - c : Remove the delay in genrating the output
    - d : desplay the statistices by openign the adapter in diagnostic mode.
    - e : display the all the statistics
    - z : resets some of the statistics back to their inital values.
