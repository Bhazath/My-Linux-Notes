# 1.2 Given a scenario, manage files and directories.
---
# 1) File and directory operations

- mv :- Move
- cp :- copy 
- mkdir :- create a folder
- rmdir :- redir a folder
- ls :- last (ex: ls -al, ls -l)
- pwd :- present work directorie
- rm :- remove
- cd :- change directory [Note: Using cd you can go to your user main directories (~/)]
- . :- cournt folder
- .. :- parent folder
- ~  :- home folder
- tree :- tree view of folder
- cat :- concatenate
- touch :- to create file (ex: touch hello.txt)

# 2) Soft and hard links

- Soft links : Soft Link or Symbolic links
  ```
  $ ln -s {file.txt} {Softfile.txt}
  # -s for Soft file  
  ```

- Hard links : Each hard linked file is assigned the same Inode value as the original, therefore they reference the same physical file location. Hard links more flexible and remain linked even if the original or linked files are moved throughout the file system, although hard links are unable to cross different file systems
  ```
  $ ln {file1.txt} {file2.txt}
  ```
  Note: For example, if we have a file a.txt. If we create a hard link to the file and then delete the file, we can still access the file using hard link. But if we create a soft link of the file and then delete the file, we canâ€™t access the file through soft link and soft link becomes dangling. Basically hard link increases reference count of a location while soft links work as a shortcut (like in Windows) 

# 3) File metadata

- File :- till us what kind of file it is
- stat :- a powerful tool used to display detailed information about a file or file system

# 4) File Edithing
